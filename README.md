* _3:00 - 5:00 ~ I hit a bump with me design so I need to take it by the owner and finalize some things. So for the last 2 hours I researched the google maps api as well as making api calls and some of the better ways of doing things like routing and cool things I could bring in to it like when you scroll it builds a house in the background. I also have been mapping out what the website will look like._
